      The <Term type="package">idstore</Term> package is extensively instrumented with
      <LinkExternal target="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</LinkExternal>
      in order to allow for the server to be continually monitored. The package publishes
      <Link target="52a79cba-d824-41e2-b9b2-07f3edf6c8b4">metrics</Link>,
      logs, and traces, all of which can be independently enabled or disabled. Most installations will only want to
      enable metrics or logs in production; traces are more useful when trying to diagnose performance
      problems, or for doing actual development on the <Term type="package">idstore</Term> package.

              to HTTP response times, and this metric can be used to subtract those delays

        Most metrics are labelled with various attributes that allow for distinguishing between
        requests that occurred as part of the user service, or part of the admin service. Metrics
        involving the mail system typically include the destination address as an attribute.

        The package <Term type="term">may</Term> produce other metrics, however these are undocumented and
        should not be relied upon.
